# Pictures at an exhibition of essentials
## A curated guide

If you're familiar with Christoph Gie√üelink's art, this project will probably be meaningful to you. Searching for deeper meaning myself, I was fortunate to find the core of this project in a post by ijabbott. My respect to both Christoph and ijabbott for their *Pioneer*ing work, without which I'd still be stuggling.

The post itself left out a lot of detail and so I figured this would be a good oppotunity to archive how to receive enlightenment in case I ever needed to replicate the process myself.

The art is not my own and I would encourage anyone who is interested to visit Christoph's gallery.

### Requirements

This project uses PNG library and has been tested with version 1.6. This also means that I had to build it on Linux for now. I may explore how to make this more universal in the future.

    $ sudo apt install build-essential cmake libpng-dev
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    build$ cmake .. && make

You should now have an executable binary in the build folder which will let you see the art in a new way.
